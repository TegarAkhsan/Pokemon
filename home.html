                <h1>Pikachu HOREG</h1>
                <p>Pikachu, a beloved Electric-type Pokémon, is known for its small, mouse-like appearance, featuring bright yellow fur, red cheeks, and a lightning bolt-shaped tail. 
                    As the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, Pikachu has become an iconic figure representing the series' playful and adventurous spirit. Its electric abilities allow it to generate and release powerful electric shocks, which it stores in its cheeks. 
                    This ability is not only used for battling opponents but also for assisting in various situations, such as powering up devices or defending its trainer. 
                    Pikachu’s friendly and energetic nature makes it a popular partner for trainers worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>In battle, Pikachu's most notable move is "Thunderbolt," a high-damage electric attack that showcases its power. 
                    Pikachu can also use other moves like "Quick Attack" and "Iron Tail," demonstrating its versatility and agility in combat. 
                    One of its special abilities, "Static," can paralyze opponents upon contact, giving Pikachu an advantage by hindering the enemy's mobility. 
                    Despite its small size, Pikachu’s electric power and strategic abilities make it a formidable and adaptable Pokémon, appealing to both casual and competitive trainers alike.

            <h2>History of Pokémon</h2>
            <p>Pokémon began as a video game concept created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori in the early 1980s in Japan.
                Tajiri, who grew up collecting insects, was inspired by his love of nature and exploration. 
                Together with Game Freak, a magazine that later evolved into a game development company, they created a world where players could catch and train small creatures known as Pokémon. 
                In 1996, Nintendo released the game for the Game Boy, and Pokémon immediately gained massive popularity in Japan.
                This success spread internationally, with games, collectible cards, an animated series, and a film following.
                Pokémon has not only become a pop culture phenomenon but has also created a very profitable industry for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. 
                The animated series, which follows the journey of the character Ash Ketchum,brought Pokémon to a global level, making it one of the biggest media franchises in the world. 
                To this day, Pokémon continues to thrive with new generations of games, spin-offs, and adaptations that continue to captivate fans of all ages.
